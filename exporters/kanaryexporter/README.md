## Kanary Exporter

This `kanaryexporter` (implemented in `kanaryexporter.go`) is a Prometheus exporter designed to monitor Kanary signal values derived from a PostgreSQL database. It exposes two primary metrics: `kanary_up` and `kanary_error`.

**General Exporter Behavior:**

* Accesses DB that has load test results for konflux clusters
* Calculates `kanary_up` and `kanary_error` metrics periodically
* Metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint

---

### `kanary_up` Metric

The `kanary_up` metric indicates the health status of a target cluster based on recent load test results.

* **Metric Name:** `kanary_up`
* **Value `1` (UP):**
    * If data processing is successful and at least one of the recent (number defined in code) tests succeeded.
    * **Crucially** if any error is encountered in the exporter.
      * This is a safety mechanism that ensures that alerts will not trigger when the kanary status cannot be determined.
* **Value `0` (DOWN):**
    * If data processing is successful and all the recent (number defined in code) tests failed.

### `kanary_error` Metric

The `kanary_error` metric reports any errors preventing the exporter from exporting the kanary signal.

* **Metric Name:** `kanary_error`
* **Value `1`:**
  * **Error reasons (in metric label `reason`):**
      * `"no_test_results"`: The latest test result in the database for a given cluster is too old. This could be an issue with:
        * Test not being triggered by underlying automation
        * Test results are not exported to the database
      * `"db_error"`: Indicates a problem related to database interaction or data validation. This could be:
        * Failed query
        * Missing data
        * Connection issues
        * ...
* **Value `0`:**
  * No issues in exporting the kanary signal

## Development

* To run locally:
    * `CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{dbname}?sslmode=disable" go run ./kanaryexporter.go`
